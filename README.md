## Apointment Reminders in ASP.NET MVC

This example demonstrates how to use Twilio to create automatic appointment reminders for your business users.

## Running Locally

To run this project locally you'll need to move/rename `AppointmentReminders.Web/Web.config.sample` to `AppointmentReminders.Web/Web.config`.

You'll need to change these values for the ones you need.

```xml
<appSettings>
  ...
  <add key="TwilioNumber" value="TWILIO_NUMBER"/>
  <add key="AccountSid" value="ACCOUNT_SID"/>
  <add key="AuthToken" value="AUTH_TOKEN"/>
</appSettings>
```

You might also need to run through the initial set of migrations for Entity Framework. In the NuGet Package Manager console, enter:

```bash
Update-Database
```
